# Task: Implement the Power Method for Finding the Largest Eigenvalue and Corresponding Eigenvector

# 1. Import numpy with its corresponding alias.



# 2. Define a function power_method that finds the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector.
#    - Parameters:
#      - A: The matrix for which you want to find the largest eigenvalue.
#      - b: The initial guess for the eigenvector.
#      - num_iter: The number of iterations to run the power method.



    # 3. Set the numpy random seed value to 13.



    # 4. Initialize a variable called eigenvector and set it equal to a random vector
    # with the correct length.



    # 5. Loop through the prescribed number of iterations.



        # 6. Update eigenvector via the correct matrix multiplication.



        # 7. Update eigenvector so that it is normalized.



    # 8. Compute the Rayleigh quotient to approximate the largest eigenvalue.
    # Call the output eigenvalue.



    # 9. Return the eigenvalue, eigenvector pair.



# 10. Import the check_eigensystem function from task_1.



# 11. Initialize a square matrix A to be the following:
# | 4 3 |
# | 1 3 |



# 12. Use the power_method function with 1000 iterations to calculate the
# largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of A.



# 13. Use the check_eigensystem function to confirm that the eigenvalue and
# eigenvector above is indeed an eigenpair of A. You will have to input
# the eigenvalue and eigenvector each as a list (of one element each).
